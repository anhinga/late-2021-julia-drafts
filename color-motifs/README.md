A number of people told me that it would be a good idea to bring some color motifs into our "matrix multiplication machines" framework.

In that framework we found that it is fruitful to interpret monochrome images as matrices and use matrix multiplication to make new images.

A number of people are saying that it would be nice to start exploring color motifs in this context.
